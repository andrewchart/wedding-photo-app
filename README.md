# wedding-photo-app
I built this app to allow guests at my wedding to simply and easily share 
photos and videos they captured during the day with us and other guests. 

The app was hosted as a public website and made available during the event. 
Anyone who knew the address of the site could upload media, and view the 
media that others had uploaded. 

My primary aim was to make it as simple as possible for guests to upload photos
to a "private" website / storage location so we could have everybody's best
photos in one, collated location to enjoy after the event.

## Features
* A simple one-page website for event guests to upload photos & videos
** Guests can view photos & videos uploaded by others in an event gallery
** Guests can view large versions of the media in a lightbox
** Managers can delete media on-the-fly to remove duplicates or inappropriate content
* Designed primarily for use on mobile phones
** Support for image CDN to deliver resolution/quality-optimised images
** Transcoded video assets for streaming on mobile connections
** Original uploads are all stored in a storage bucket with no loss of quality
